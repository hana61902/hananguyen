        Enter bio here<br><br>

        I am a business administration and economics major at university of california, riverside. During highschool i participated in many business related clubs including fbla and deca and many other clubs. I also went on business related trips that revolve around the idea of economic stability.Traveled abroad and learned about indigenous cultures and customs, did volunteer work for the community: painting a mural, building a bike for an elderly center, tutor, cook, building gardens. Domestic Violence Research, worked as an assistant with the organizations Maitri Organization and Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE)
        Managed awareness campaigns, organized resources, hosted events, managed childcare for victims, and organized activities. Spent over 100 hours creating art to sell, Art Charity Show, proceeds go to children in Vietnam to buy necessary school supplies for proper education, commitment.Provide communication skills while interacting with parent guardians, tutor children in groups of 2-5, set up activities, organized schedule, time management, professional communication, patience. I decided to work with NARAL Pro-Choice California, a non-profit organization, located in San Francisco, California. I was given the opportunity to work with one of the Senior Organizing Managers at NARAL, Allie Lahey. Allie is very passionate about helping women fight for their reproductive rights and her organization works solely around trying to change the future. At NARAL, I was able to work with Allie and become familiar with what is already being done to help alleviate this social issue. One thing that I was able to do was to create profiles and biographies of each political candidate that supported women's rights and wanted to help create an impact on the issue. Another thing that I was given the chance to do was to send recruitment texts and reach out to those who decided to support this organization. These phone calls and texts brought their attention to certain events, such as rallies, dinners, socials, and etc.
        NARAL Pro-Choice California is a pro-choice advocacy organization that fights to protect a womenâ€™s right to all reproductive healthcare services which include abortions, contraceptives, family planning, or bearing a child. As an organization, they hold events to gather more supporters or to inform the community about the current facts and statistics and how women are being negatively impacted every day. These events are held to gain more members to fight for equality in womenâ€™s reproductive healthcare and it encourages them to want to get more involved. Furthermore, NARAL works with progressive allies to proceed with legislation that will protect reproductive rights and stop regressive policies from falling through. Overall, my service with NARAL has definitely taught me information that connected to the questions I had about my social issue. However, one thing that I wished I did with this organization was to actually attend the events that they held, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I did not have the chance to. Being able to be a part of these events would have allowed me to understand how and why community involvement is a crucial part of alleviating this issue. In addition, I know that it would have been an enjoyable part of my service and it would enlighten me to want to do more than just being a volunteer.
